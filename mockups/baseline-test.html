Tschichold was the son of a provincial signwriter, and he was trained in
 calligraphy. In 1919, he began in the class of Hermann Delitzsch a 
study on the "Leipzig Academy of the arts". Due to his extraordinary 
achievements, he soon became a master pupil of the rector of Walter 
Tiemann – a font designer for the Gebr.-Klingspor foundry and was 
commissioned to his fellow students. At the same time, he received the 
first orders in the framework of the "Leipziger Messe" and in 1923 set 
up his own business as a typographic consultant to a print shop.</p>

<h3>Life</h3>
<p>This artisan background and calligraphic training set him apart from 
almost all other noted typographers of the time, since they had 
inevitably trained in architecture or the fine arts. It also may help 
explain why he never worked with handmade papers and custom fonts as 
many typographers did, preferring instead to use stock fonts on a 
careful choice from commercial paper stocks. </p>

<h3>Early life and education</h3>
<p>Josef Müller was born May 9, 1914 in Rapperswil, Switzerland.[2][3] 
He studied architecture, design and art history at both the University 
of Zurich at Gewerbeschule,[2] and Zurich University of the Arts (also 
known as Kunstgewerbeschule Zurich), where he studied with Ernst Keller 
and Alfred Willimann.[3]

He apprenticed in design and advertising with Walter Diggelman.[4] In 
1936, he opened his Zurich design studio specializing in graphic design,
 exhibition design, and photography. In 1937, he joined the Swiss 
Werkbund (Swiss Association of Artists and Designers).[5] His favorite 
typeface to use was Akzidenz-Grotesk.[2][6] </p>
